    <P>
    Bowie managed to change ahead of the market - usually successfully. If he missed he changed again. It is a cute trick that we can learn from.

    Bowie detected trends, identified threats and opportunities to develop skills for tomorrow.

    Frequent ch-ch-ch-changes of job, role and organisations ensures that reinvention is necessary to survive and succeed in the predicted future workplace - or will it be Ziggy Career Dust for you?

    Let's learn from the star man and apply some of his creative techiques, without having to look like: a crazed doll, malevalent aristo or space cadet. Cool ginger is good, though.
    </P><P>
    The patterns behind the dark star depict changing conditions. How do we make sense of them? 
    </P><P>
    Firstly we can move Station to Station radially from Chaos to Certainty.
    </P>
    <P>
    Secondly we can use intuition to move between the points on the star.
    </P>
    <P>
    The third and fastest path is through the Mobius loop below the star. That, however, requires a twist and step change in personal understanding which is not alway possible because of constraints, especially if stuck in group think.<br>

  We may not aspire to stand out from the crowd as Bowie did but we will need to differnetiate from the neuromimetic machines that are forecast to 
  replace many jobs. We can take the techniques that Bowie and his fine collaborators used and apply them in business contexts.
  <P></P>
  <div>
  One technique Bowie had to <b>bound and relax constraints</b> was Dadaist "cut-up" word play.
  It can be applied to business issues <a href="http://comscientia.com/blocs/bound-relax/" target="_blank">using this app</a>

    Brian Eno, who collaborated on the Berlin trilogy, devised a set of <b>oblique strategies</b> for personal creative work.

    The Scan, Analyse, Design, Value cycle is an upgrade to the Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle. It is a reflection of the change from
    manufacturing to knowledge work.
    <P></P>
    To look into the changes that may come as the transition takes place we will use some strategic models. If they are new to you 
    they may appear as gobbledygook on a first read.

    Did Bowie keep his screw down hairdo under a hat - like a cat from Japan?

  Cultural norms between Japan and the United Kingdom show marked differences in individualism and attitude to risk. (Source: Hofstede)
  </P>
  <P>
  When Bowie was referencing Japan the country was a paragon of dull efficiency. It is still up there but has not performed a Lazarus economic turn-around.
  <P></P>
  We need to be wary when implementing the best practises of Japanese production line methodologies (Kanban) to manage creative endeavours. Both creating and producing are essential to the value chains â€“ but there are differences that can lead to frustration between strategy, operations, delivery and customers.

  Stepping down from global to corporate culture here are three real-world examples of climate that 
  reflect attitude to idea time and support in different types of organisations. Which one do you work in? Which would you like to work in?

     Debates, Trust and Openness and Freedom.

    Licensing of Intellectual Property [IP] will increase once intellectual capital audits are appreciated and in place.

    What IP do you have as an organisation?
